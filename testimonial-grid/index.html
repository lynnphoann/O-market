                                professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll

                                did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.

                                project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way

                                could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of

                                experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
